### Overwrite display name
In Misskey, there was a case that the Name displayed on the screen was different from the nickname which used in the conversation between Misskey users. It was very complicated to have a difference of Name and the nickname. So, I implemented a function to overwrite the nickname and only display it on Milktea.<br>
